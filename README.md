# Guide for Exploration of the Optimization Space (GEOS) 
The Guide for Exploration of the Optimization Space is a LLVM tool designed for be used by heuristics in the search for good optimization sequences. This tool, which is also known as GEOS, provides a set of analysis that can mensure the execution time of a LLVM code. By invoking GEOS the heuristic can be guided without executing the code, what can be seriously faster.
